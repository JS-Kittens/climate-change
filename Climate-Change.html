  <p1>The most general definition of climate change is a change in the statistical
    properties (principally its mean and spread) of the climate system when
    considered over long periods of time, regardless of cause. Accordingly,
    fluctuations over periods shorter than a few decades, such as El Ni√±o, do not
    represent climate change.</p1>
    <p2>The term "climate change" is often used to refer specifically to anthropogenic
    climate change (also known as global warming). Anthropogenic climate change
    is caused by human activity, as opposed to changes in climate that may have
    resulted as part of Earth's natural processes. In this sense, especially
    in the context of environmental policy, the term climate change has become
    synonymous with anthropogenic global warming. Within scientific journals,
    global warming refers to surface temperature increases while climate change
    includes global warming and everything else that increasing greenhouse gas
    levels affect.</p2>
    <p3>A related term is "climatic change". In 1966, the World Meteorological
      Organization (WMO) proposed the term "climatic change" to encompass all forms
      of climatic variability on time-scales longer than 10 years, regardless of
      cause. Change was a given and climatic was used as an adjective to describe
      this kind of change (as opposed to political or economic change). When it
      was realized that human activities had a potential to drastically alter
      the climate, the term climate change replaced climatic change as the
      dominant term to reflect an anthropogenic cause. Climate change was
      incorporated in the title of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
      (IPCC) and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
      Climate change, used as a noun, became an issue rather than the technical
      description of changing weather.</p3>
