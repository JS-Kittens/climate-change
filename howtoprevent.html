      <h1>What Can I Do ?</h1>
      <h2>Here are 10 ways to prevent Climate Change.</h2>
  <article id="getinvolved">
    <p1>1. Get involved</p1><br>
    <p2>Take a few minutes to contact your political representatives and the
      media to tell them you want immediate action on climate change. Remind
      them that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will also build healthier
      communities, spur economic innovation and create new jobs. And next time
      you're at the polls, vote for politicians who support effective climate
      policies.</p2><br>
     <p3>2. Be energy efficient</p3><br>
    <p4>You already switch off lights — what's next? Change light bulbs to
      compact fluorescents or LEDs. Unplug computers, TVs and other
      electronics when not in use. Wash clothes in cold or warm (not hot)
      water. Dryers are energy hogs, so hang dry when you can. Install a
      programmable thermostat. Look for the Energy Star® label when buying
      new appliances. And a home energy audit is cheaper than you think —
      book one today to find even more ways to save energy.</p4><br>
    <p5>3. Choose renewable power</p5><br>
    <p6>Ask your utility to switch your account to clean, renewable power,
      such as from wind farms. If it doesn't offer this option yet, ask it to.
    </p6><br>
    <p7>4. Eat wisely</p7><br>
    <p8>Buy organic and locally grown foods. Avoid processed items. Grow some
      of your own food. And eat low on the food chain — at least one meat-free
      meal a day — since 18 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions come from
      meat and dairy production. Food writer Michael Pollan sums it up best:
      "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."</p8><br>
    <p9>5. Trim your waste<br></p9>
    <p10>Garbage buried in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
       Keep stuff out of landfills by composting kitchen scraps and garden
       trimmings, and recycling paper, plastic, metal and glass. Let store
       managers and manufacturers know you want products with minimal or
       recyclable packaging.</p10><br>
    <p11>6. Let polluters pay</p11><br>
    <p12>Carbon taxes make polluting activities more expensive and green
      solutions more affordable, allowing energy-efficient businesses and
      households to save money. They are one of the most effective ways to
      reduce Canada's climate impact. If your province doesn't have a carbon
      tax, ask your premier and MLA to implement one.</p12><br>
    <p13>7. Fly less</p13><br>
    <p14>Air travel leaves behind a huge carbon footprint. Before you book
      your next airline ticket, consider greener options such as buses or
      trains, or try vacationing closer to home. You can also stay in touch
      with people by videoconferencing, which saves time as well as travel
      and accommodation costs.</p14><br>
    <p15>8. Get informed</p15><br>
    <p16>Follow the latest news about climate change.</p16><br>
    <p17>9. Green your commute</p17><br>
    <p18>Transportation causes about 25 per cent of Canada's greenhouse gas
      emissions, so walk, cycle or take transit whenever you can. You'll save
      money and get into better shape! If you can't go car-free, try
      carpooling or car sharing, and use the smallest, most fuel-efficient
      vehicle possible.</p18><br>
    <p19>10. Support and Donate</19><br>
    <p20>Many organizations, including the David Suzuki Foundation, are
      working hard on solutions to climate change and rely on financial
      support from citizens like you. Consider making a donation today by
      calling 1-800-453-1533.</p20><br>
